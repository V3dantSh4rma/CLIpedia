<h2>[Optional] The "-o" flag. </h2>
It is derived from the term english term 'output'. When this flag is given along with the Valid File Extension, it will create a seperate file along with the result saved in it.

# Do's and Don'ts 
<h3> Do's: </h3>

```clipedia "file explorer" -o <valid file extension>```

The command above is the right way and will be executed successfully as it is written in the right format.

<h3> Don'ts: </h3>

```clipedia file explorer -o <valid file extension>```

The command above will not be successfull because **if your query is more than one word, it will require a string**. Eg: ``"file explorer"`` and not: ``file explorer``.
